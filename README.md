# eliminmax/mindustry-logic-scripts

A repository for programs written in Mindustry Logic, the low-level programming language used by processors in [Mindustry](https:/github.com/Anuken/Mindustry)

I use a few mods in my game, and sometimes my scripts reference their content. I believe the only mod that is currently referenced is [reVision](https://github.com/Slava0135/reVision) by @Slava0135.
