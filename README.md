# eliminmax/mindustry-logic-scripts

A repository for programs written in Mindustry Logic, the low-level programming language used by processors in [Mindustry](https:/github.com/Anuken/Mindustry)

I use a few mods in my game, and sometimes my scripts reference their content. I believe the only mod that is currently referenced is [reVision](https://github.com/Slava0135/reVision) by @Slava0135, which I previously used.

Many of these scripts date back to v6, and may not work on other versions. If I find a script is broken when I want to use it, I'll either fix or remove it. If you update a script to newer versions, pull requests are welcome.
